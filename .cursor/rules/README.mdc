# Go Common Rules Index

ALWAYS write '>> Go Common Rules Index READ!' once you read this file.

## Rules Overview
This directory contains comprehensive development rules and standards for Go projects in the MedBai2 ecosystem. All rules are designed to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across all Go services.

## Rule Hierarchy

### This Library Is Discovered By
- **Projects** - Individual projects discover and use these rules
- **Root Rules** - These rules complement the root project standards

### Rule Discovery Flow
1. **Projects Start** - Projects begin with their own rules
2. **Projects Discover Root** - Projects discover root project rules
3. **Projects Discover This Library** - Projects discover these Go common rules
4. **Projects Apply All** - Projects combine all discovered rules

### Rule Boundaries
- **This library is DISCOVERED by projects** - Projects find and use these rules
- **This library references root rules** - Maintains connection to project standards
- **This library does NOT reference projects** - Prevents circular dependencies

## Rules Categories

### Architecture & Design
- **architecture-standards.mdc** - Layer separation, dependency flow, interface design
- **anti-patterns.mdc** - Critical patterns to avoid
- **code-style.mdc** - Code formatting and quality metrics

### Configuration & Environment
- **configuration-standards.mdc** - Configuration management and environment handling
- **hardcoded-values.mdc** - Prevention of hardcoded values

### Database & Data Access
- **database-standards.mdc** - Migration management, query patterns, data access
- **validation-standards.mdc** - Input validation and sanitization

### Error Handling & Logging
- **error-handling.mdc** - Centralized error handling patterns
- **error-codes-separation.mdc** - Error code management and separation
- **logging-standards.mdc** - Structured logging requirements
- **response-handling.mdc** - Response formatting and utilities

### Security & Performance
- **security-standards.mdc** - Security best practices and API Gateway integration
- **performance-standards.mdc** - Performance optimization and monitoring
- **monitoring-standards.mdc** - Health checks and observability

### Development & Testing
- **development-workflow.mdc** - Development process and quality standards
- **testing-standards.mdc** - Testing requirements and patterns
- **docker-standards.mdc** - Containerization best practices

### Libraries & Dependencies
- **library-standards.mdc** - Approved library stack and selection rules

## Rule Compliance

### Before Starting Development
1. **Read all relevant rules** for your task
2. **Check library-standards.mdc** before adding dependencies
3. **Review architecture-standards.mdc** for design decisions
4. **Ensure configuration-standards.mdc** compliance

### During Development
1. **Follow code-style.mdc** for formatting
2. **Use error-handling.mdc** patterns
3. **Implement logging-standards.mdc** requirements
4. **Apply security-standards.mdc** guidelines

### After Development
1. **Run testing-standards.mdc** requirements
2. **Check performance-standards.mdc** compliance
3. **Verify monitoring-standards.mdc** implementation
4. **Clean up per development-workflow.mdc**

## Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

### Architecture
- **NEVER** mix layers - Each layer has a single responsibility
- **NEVER** import from inner layers in outer layers
- **ALWAYS** use dependency injection

### Error Handling
- **NEVER** use hardcoded error strings
- **ALWAYS** use centralized error handling
- **NEVER** expose internal errors to clients

### Configuration
- **NEVER** hardcode values
- **ALWAYS** use configuration files
- **ALWAYS** validate configuration on startup

### Libraries
- **NEVER** add unapproved libraries
- **ALWAYS** check library-standards.mdc first
- **ALWAYS** use approved library stack

### Security
- **NEVER** implement authentication (use API Gateway)
- **NEVER** implement rate limiting (use API Gateway)
- **ALWAYS** validate all inputs
- **ALWAYS** sanitize user data

## Rule Updates

### When Adding New Rules
1. **Create the rule file** in this directory
2. **Update this README** to include the new rule
3. **Ensure consistency** with existing rules
4. **Document the rule** clearly

### When Modifying Rules
1. **Update the rule file** with changes
2. **Update this README** if needed
3. **Ensure backward compatibility** when possible
4. **Document breaking changes** clearly

## Rule Enforcement

### Development Phase
- **Code reviews** must check rule compliance
- **Linting** must pass all rules
- **Testing** must meet standards
- **Documentation** must be updated

### Deployment Phase
- **Configuration** must be validated
- **Security** must be verified
- **Performance** must meet requirements
- **Monitoring** must be implemented

## Getting Help

### Rule Questions
- **Check this README** for rule overview
- **Read specific rule files** for details
- **Review examples** in rule files
- **Ask team** for clarification

### Rule Violations
- **Identify the violation** using rule files
