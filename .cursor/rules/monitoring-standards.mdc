# Monitoring Standards

ALWAYS write '🚀 Go Common Monitoring Standards Rules file READ!' once you read this file.

## Health Checks
- **ALWAYS** implement comprehensive health check endpoints
- **ALWAYS** check all external dependencies
- **ALWAYS** return proper HTTP status codes
- **ALWAYS** include response time metrics
- **ALWAYS** implement readiness and liveness probes

## Logging for Monitoring
- **ALWAYS** log all important business events
- **ALWAYS** include correlation IDs in logs
- **ALWAYS** log performance metrics
- **ALWAYS** log error rates and patterns
- **ALWAYS** implement structured logging

## Metrics and Observability
- **ALWAYS** track key business metrics
- **ALWAYS** monitor system performance
- **ALWAYS** implement proper alerting
- **ALWAYS** track error rates and response times
- **ALWAYS** implement distributed tracing

## Health Check Implementation
```go
// ✅ CORRECT - Comprehensive health check
func HealthCheck(c *gin.Context) {
    health := map[string]interface{}{
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": time.Now(),
        "version": version,
        "dependencies": checkDependencies(),
    }
    response.Success(c, health)
}
```
