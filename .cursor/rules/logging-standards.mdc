# Logging Standards

ALWAYS write '🚀 Go Common Logging Standards Rules file READ!' once you read this file.

## Structured Logging
```go
// ✅ CORRECT - Structured logging with context
logger.Info("User created successfully", map[string]interface{}{
    "userId": user.ID,
    "name": user.Name,
})

// ❌ WRONG - Simple string logging
log.Printf("User created: %s", user.Name)
```

## Logging Requirements
- **ALWAYS** use JSON format
- **ALWAYS** include request ID
- **ALWAYS** include relevant context
- **ALWAYS** use appropriate log levels
- **ALWAYS** avoid logging sensitive data

## Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging
- **INFO**: General information about application flow
- **WARN**: Warning messages for potential issues
- **ERROR**: Error messages for failures

## Logging Checklist
- [ ] Structured logging with JSON format
- [ ] Request ID included in all logs
- [ ] Appropriate log level used
- [ ] No sensitive data logged
- [ ] Context information included
